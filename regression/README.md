## üìù About the Project  
In this project, the bulldozers past sales prices are used to predict the sale price of future bulldozers based on their characteristics.
- Inputs: Bulldozer characteristics such as make year, base model, model series, state of sale (e.g. which US state was it sold in), drive system and more.
- Outputs: Bulldozer sale price (in USD).
This is a typical regression problem since we need to predict a numerical value. And since we're predicting results with a time component (predicting future sales based on past sales), this is also known as a *time series* or *forecasting* problem.

## ‚ú® Overview
We will go through the 6-step Machine Learning model framework.

1. Identify the problem:
We are trying to answer the question: How well can we predict future sale price of a bulldozer, based on past sale points and bulldozer characteristics?

2. Dataset: The dataset can be found [License]([#license](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)).
